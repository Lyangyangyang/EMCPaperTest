Test Cases:

1: Create one or multiple LUNs
Test Objective: Lun£¨one or more£©could be created successfully
Test Procedures:1.Navigate to Lun management page£¬find create lun button£¬make sure it is in the right place £¨Appearance£©
		        2.Create one lun ,input both reasonable/unreasonable name£¬like input null or some other thing,then verify the result
			    3.With size attribute,input 0G and one big number that over capacity the storage allowed. 
				4.After creating lun,verify if it lists right
				5.Create multiple luns,make sure each could be created successfully
Expected result: with reasonable parameter,lun/luns created successfully,with unreasonable parameter there should be reminder and return error

2: Resize (expand) a LUN
Test Objective: Size of lun could be resized successfully
Test Procedures:1.Navigate to Lun management page
                2.select one lun,change the size attribute to 0,1,and one big number that over capacity the storage allowed
                3.After resizing lun,verify if it lists right
Expected results:with reasonable parameter,lun can be resized successfully ,with unreasonable parameter there should be reminder and return error
               
3: Export a LUN to a host
Test Objective: Export a lun to a host successfully
Host platform: All platforms that storage supported
Configuration: config iscsi for host
Test Procedures:1.Navigate to Lun management page
                2.Select one LUN that has not been exported to one host,export it to a real/non-existing host(with different configuration)
				3.Select one LUN that has been exported to one host, try to export it to another host,shoud be failed 
                4.If export action succeeds,verify lun lists right from host side
Expected results:With host non-existing or inproper configuration,it should be failed .Or lun should be exported to a host successfully.
             
4: un-export a LUN
Test Objective: Un-exported a lun from a host successfully
Host platform: All platforms that storage supported
Configuration: config iscsi for host
Test Procedures:1.Navigate to Lun management page
                2.Select one LUN that has not been exported to one host,select un-export it ,should be failed  
				3.Select one LUN that has been exported to one host, un-export it when lun is been used or not.
Expected results:LUNs can be un-exported successfully 

5: Remove an un-exported LUN
Test Objective: LUN can be removed successfully if it is un-exported
Test Procedures:1.Navigate to Lun management page
                2.Select one LUN that has not been exported to one host,select remove it  
				3.Select one LUN that has been exported to one host, select remove it,should be failed ,return warning should un-export it first
Expected results:Un-exported lun can be removed successfully

6: Retrieve the information (size, export) of a LUN
Test Objective:Retrieve the information of a LUN
Host platform: All platforms that storage supported
Test Procedures:1.Navigate to Lun management page
                2.select one lun and select show info of it 
                3.verify the result
Expected results:Information of a LUN listed right

7: Concurrent requests is supported
Test Objective: Verify  concurrent requests is supported
Test Procedures:1.create lun with same name at same time on different browsers,check the result,only one succeed
                2.Export a lun to different/same host at same time on different browsers
				3.Un-export a lun at same time on different browsers
				4.Edit/delete lun at same time
                
Expected results:Concurrent requests can be handled right
           
8: Performance is not impacted no matter how many LUN¡¯s are created and exported
Test Objective: Verify performance is not  impacted 
Tools : Loadrunner or other performance test tool
Test Procedures:1. create/export as many as luns
                2. check performance(IOPS)
Expected results:Performance is not impacted
